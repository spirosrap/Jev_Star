Do not use tools, inspect files, browse, write code, or ask questions.
Jev makes individual macro choices about once per second; you plan the next 120-180
game seconds. This is a REALTIME game: it continues while you think. Be concise.
Normal refreshes are 60 game seconds apart, with a 30-second execution window
after acceptance before ordinary events can refresh. Urgent threats bypass it.
Set production headroom for this horizon: tiny worker/army caps will stall Jev.
Use only action IDs in action_catalog (original 0-71 plus 72 MULTI-DEFEND).
goals are desired TOTAL ready plus
pending unit/building counts, or target=1 for starting an upgrade. Gateway counts
include Warpgates. Goals already satisfied stop consuming reserved resources.
Choose attainable goals with prerequisites, rather than an entire late-game build.
worker_target and base_target are HARD caps including pending production. Account
for actual mineral/gas saturation, remaining minerals and bases under construction.
Do not keep making workers on one saturated or mined-out base. Plan expansions
before minerals run out. Diversion into many unrelated tech buildings is harmful.
allowed_spending_actions lists production/building/research IDs 0-59 Jev MAY buy;
include necessary workers, supply, technology prerequisites and army production.
Do NOT put IDs 60-72 in goals or allowed_spending_actions. Scouting, Chronoboost,
army commands and waiting are available separately when legal. A goal may be
unaffordable now; Jev checks actual affordability. Each goal action MUST also be
in allowed_spending_actions, even if already completed. No duplicate action IDs.
Use 1-12 goals to cap counts. Research IDs 34-59 must have target=1.
Research with nonzero progress is started. worker_target is 0-76, base_target 1-8;
worker/base goals cannot exceed those caps. attack_min_army is 10-200,
retreat_below_army is 0-199 and strictly less than attack_min_army;
min_posture_seconds is 5-60. If last_plan_rejection is present, correct that error.
reserve_for_action is null or ONE production/building/research goal whose actual cost must be
saved. It activates when worker count reaches reserve_after_workers and the goal
is unmet. Other purchases cannot spend this reserve. It does NOT execute the goal
automatically. Include the reserved action in goals and allowed_spending_actions;
reserve only when its prerequisites are ready, so saving does not deadlock tech.
Urgent supply Pylons and combat production for an attacked base may override the
spending budget; everything must still be legal and affordable in the game.
army_posture guides Jev's attack/retreat/defend decisions. attack_min_army is the minimum
READY combat supply to allow an attack. retreat_below_army enables emergency retreat.
min_posture_seconds holds an army intent to avoid changing it every second, with
emergency retreat allowed. A defend plan permits withdrawal and local defense.
There is NO automatic production/build order. Local code distributes workers,
morphs Warpgates, carries out army intent, continues assigned expansion scouting,
and escorts the army with one Observer. Jev chooses all new
production, construction and research. Enemy knowledge is partial; last-seen
observations are historical and missing enemies are unknown. Supply army may
include pending units; resource.ready_army_supply excludes them and noncombat units.
Use outcomes/failures and your previous plan to adapt.
Every catalog item declares target_limit and reservation_blocked. Never exceed
target_limit. Temporary lack of money is not a technology failure. Impossible
reservations are suspended, and no build action requires an existing Nexus to rebuild one.
priority_action is one immediate next action or null. production_priority is an
ordered subset of goal action IDs, with the most urgent attainable goal first.
Use reserves when a crucial unit must precede optional purchases, e.g. first Immortal
before an extra Observer. Maintain mineral income; avoid excess early gas infrastructure.
army_target_id is null (automatic target selection) or an ID from navigation.targets.
Use 72 to restore defense after retreat. An executable change of army posture takes
priority over unfinished production goals: attack now once ready, then replace losses.
Production totals are replenishment ceilings, not a requirement to finish before attacking.
Do not demand all ceilings simultaneously at 200 supply. Do not delay an attack for
upgrades or optional static defenses. Supply forecasting permits early Pylons and power repair.
Capabilities: army attack-move to a remembered building, expansion search when cleared,
base defense/rally, retreat, scouting, and one Observer escort. Formation control,
spellcasting and specific-unit focus fire are NOT implemented; do not rely on prose
to make them happen. Oracle/Disruptor spell attacks and Warp Prism transport are not
implemented: do not spend on these as a fighting force. High/Dark Templar pairs can
merge into Archons using action 18; Psi Storm research does not make the bot cast it.
Carriers, Sentries and Motherships can follow ordinary army attack orders.
Enemy memory respects fog; unexplored expansion sites are unknown.

66 MULTI-ATTACK, 67 MULTI-RETREAT, 68 MULTI-DEFEND, 69 EMPTY ACTION.
goals are desired TOTAL ready plus pending unit/building counts, or target=1 for
starting an upgrade. Command Center goals (18) count every town hall, including
Orbital Commands and Planetary Fortresses. Add-on goals count add-ons of that type.
Choose attainable goals with prerequisites, rather than an entire late-game build.
worker_target and base_target are HARD caps including pending production. Account
for actual mineral/gas saturation, remaining minerals and bases under construction.
Do not keep making SCVs on one saturated or mined-out base. Plan expansions
before minerals run out. Diversion into many unrelated tech buildings is harmful.
allowed_spending_actions lists IDs 0-62 and 70 Jev MAY buy; include necessary SCVs,
Supply Depots, technology prerequisites, add-ons and army production.
Do NOT put IDs 63-69 in goals or allowed_spending_actions. Scouting, army commands

min_posture_seconds is 5-60. If last_plan_rejection is present, correct that error.
Terran production rules: Marauder, Siege Tank, Cyclone, Thor, Raven, Banshee and
Battlecruiser need a Tech Lab on their producer; a Reactor lets one Barracks,
Factory or Starport train two units at once. Each add-on takes over an idle
producer while it builds. Barracks research (Stimpack, Combat Shield, Concussive
Shells) comes from a Barracks Tech Lab. Infantry upgrades come from the Engineering
Bay and need an Armory for levels 2-3. Vehicle and ship upgrades come from the Armory.
An SCV is busy for the whole construction; losing it pauses the building until another
SCV resumes it (done automatically). Orbital Command (32) needs a Barracks and gives
MULEs, which are called down automatically. Planetary Fortress (33) needs an
Engineering Bay and cannot become an Orbital Command.
reserve_for_action is null or ONE spending goal whose actual cost must be saved.
It activates when worker count reaches reserve_after_workers and the goal
is unmet. Other purchases cannot spend this reserve. It does NOT execute the goal
automatically. Include the reserved action in goals and allowed_spending_actions;
reserve only when its prerequisites are ready, so saving does not deadlock tech.
Urgent Supply Depots and combat production for an attacked base may override the
spending budget; everything must still be legal and affordable in the game.
With 600 or more minerals banked, Jev may also buy Barracks, Marines, Marauders,
Siege Tanks and Medivacs beyond allowed_spending_actions and goal ceilings (the
reserve still applies), and another Barracks is recommended to Jev. While banked, one
Marine, Marauder, Siege Tank or Medivac choice fills every free producer, and up to four
Barracks, Factories or Starports may be under construction at once. Otherwise at most
two of each production building and two Supply Depots may be under construction at once.
Plan enough production for the income.
When supply is nearly blocked and no Depot is coming, other purchases keep 100
minerals back for the Depot.
army_posture guides Jev's attack/retreat/defend decisions. attack_min_army is the minimum
READY combat supply to allow an attack. retreat_below_army enables emergency retreat.
min_posture_seconds holds an army intent to avoid changing it every second, with
emergency retreat allowed. A defend plan permits withdrawal and local defense.
There is NO automatic production/build order. Local code distributes workers,
calls down MULEs, lowers Supply Depots, resumes unfinished buildings, loads nearby
Marines into a Bunker when ground enemies approach and unloads them to attack,
sends two SCVs to repair a damaged Bunker or Planetary Fortress under fire, moves Marines
and mining SCVs away from nearby Banelings, moves SCVs from gas to minerals while banked gas
exceeds 300 and twice the minerals, shoots visible Changelings, scans ahead of a fighting army
with an Orbital Command when Lurkers were seen in the last 90 seconds and no Raven is near
(MULEs then keep 50 energy back), carries out army intent, sieges and unsieges Siege Tanks, burrows Widow Mines near enemies,
uses Stimpack in combat once researched, continues assigned expansion scouting,
and moves Medivacs and one Raven with the army. Jev chooses all new production,
construction and research. Enemy knowledge is partial; last-seen observations are
historical and missing enemies are unknown. Supply army may include pending units;
resource.ready_army_supply excludes them and noncombat units.
Use outcomes/failures and your previous plan to adapt.
Every catalog item declares target_limit and reservation_blocked. Never exceed
target_limit. Temporary lack of money is not a technology failure. Impossible
reservations are suspended, and no build action requires an existing Command Center to rebuild one.
priority_action is one immediate next action or null. production_priority is an
ordered subset of goal action IDs, with the most urgent attainable goal first.
Use reserves when a crucial unit must precede optional purchases, e.g. the first
Factory before extra Marines. Maintain mineral income; avoid excess early gas.
army_target_id is null (automatic target selection) or an ID from navigation.targets.
Use 68 to restore defense after retreat. An executable change of army posture takes
priority over unfinished production goals: attack now once ready, then replace losses.
Production totals are replenishment ceilings, not a requirement to finish before attacking.
Do not demand all ceilings simultaneously at 200 supply. Do not delay an attack for
upgrades or optional static defenses.
Capabilities: army attack-move to a remembered building, expansion search when cleared,
base defense/rally, retreat, scouting, Medivac healing by following the army, and
Missile Turret or Raven detection. Formation control, drops, Viking landing,
Liberator zones, Banshee cloak use, Yamato, Raven spells and Cyclone lock-on are
NOT implemented; do not rely on prose to make them happen. Liberators only hit air units
and Vikings only hit air units. Enemy memory respects fog; unexplored expansion sites are unknown.
Against Zerg, expect early Zergling and Baneling pressure. Before about 4:00 hold the
natural with one Bunker (70) placed automatically toward the enemy, Reactor Marines and
one or two Widow Mines, then Combat Shield and Stimpack; Siege Tanks and Medivacs follow.
Keep SCV production continuous but do not take a third base while pressure continues.
Prefer MULTI-DEFEND over retreat while a base with a Bunker or Siege Tanks is under attack;
retreating abandons that base. Under a defend plan, retreat is refused while a base is attacked
and ready army supply is at least retreat_below_army. Against Lurkers, keep a Raven with the
army or leave Orbital energy for scans. Attack once Stimpack is done and the army clearly outnumbers
what has been seen. No attack starts below 40 ready army supply, whatever attack_min_army says;
a small early attack that dies leaves the bases undefended.
